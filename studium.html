    <p class="bold">Introduction</p>
    <p>The studium app is a study app prototype aimed to help students or learners to be productive and stay away from distractions of all other apps including entertainment apps. The unique characteristic of the app is that it has a rewarding gashapon game built in which can be rewarding and motivating to the users and help them stay focused. </p>
    <p class="bold">
      Design Hypothesis
    </p>
    <p>I believe that creating a focus management app for people who have a hard time trying to be productive will help them to focus and concentrate, providing them a motivative and rewarding experience to stay focused. I will know the hypothesis is valid when I get most people agreeing with the functionality of the gashapon game and they will likel</p>
    <p class="bold">Needfinding</p>
  <p>
    In my needfinding process, I interviewed a few of my friends and I also made a google form to survey a broader range of potential users. The questions in my survey are as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>How much confidence do you have when you decide to study and to put everything away for a certain amount of time?      </li>
   <li>Do you find studying at home somewhat less efficient than studying with others or in a library?
  </li>
  <li>What are the things that usually distracts you while working or studying?
  </li>
  <li>Do you consider your smartphone a big part of distraction to you or not?
  </li>
  <li>If the previous question is yes, what are some apps that distract you, or when do you find your smartphone being the biggest obstacle when you try to study?
  </li>
  <li>What are some factors that might help you to focus when you find that you have the need to? (Ex, studying in the library, put the phone far away, etc)
  </li>
  <li>What do you think of the existing apps that are there to help you focus, do you use them or find them useful to you?
  </li>
  <li>What are some features you wish the app to have?
  </li>
</ol>
  </div>
 <div>
  
    <p>The overall response to my survey is that they all find it somewhat hard to put their phones away and to focus on their work. 100% of people think that quarantine also makes them less efficient at doing their work. Also, 100% of them consider smartphones as a big part of distraction when they are trying to focus. Therefore, I think that my hypothesis is correct and the app will be useful to my users. 
Many have also mentioned the forest app, so I also downloaded the app to see its functions and features. I found out that the “study together” feature exists in the app, however, the app cannot set certain apps that are allowed to be used such as camera app, calculator app, etc. I think it would be a useful feature to add. Additionally, through my observation and experiences, the forest app is not simple enough because it seems to have too many unnecessary features. 
One thing I didn’t put in my google form survey is about the Gashapon game I mentioned in my product statement, but I interviewed several friends and they all think that the Gashapon game sounds like a motivative and rewarding feature to add. This game is also what differentiates my app from the forest app. The forest app is so attached with the trees which users can buy but many trees in the app aren’t even cute. As a motivating feature and main characteristic of the app, it already loses some of its users. While focusing, the growing tree shows up on the screen, which is very much unnecessary and could be somehow distracting. My app, instead, keeps the gashapon feature on it’s own so the users are only able to access any part of the feature before or after the focusing period. Although it is a game, it only takes seconds to play one game and it’s highly fun and exciting to play.

<p class="bold">Evaluation</p>
<p style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;">After my first prototype, I got suggestions about my color selections of the font and other buttons. I thought they were helpful because some of my buttons did not look like buttons, instead, like text inputs. I reconsidered those color choices and added empty states for the login and register screens for a better UX. The emojis I initially had for friends’ profile photos did not show up in the actual testing process so I kept that in mind for my second prototype.
  The second prototype was where I added the most features, such as the study with friends feature, the completed gashapon game, adding friends, editing enabled apps, etc. After my second prototype, I found a couple of friends to test my app. They liked the functionality and gave me minor suggestions. They wish that there’s a tag feature where users can categorize their focus time and see a clear distribution of their hours. 
  After I’ve done my final prototype for the app, I asked 6 of my friends to go through and test the app again. I got some valuable feedback which I considered and found helpful for future purposes. First, most of them are also forest users, they consider this app to have a cleaner look and feel to it. However, it is hard to sometimes navigate on the home page. There are rarely any word indications and even though there are signs and graphics. For example, the + sign conveys a clear message to me or recurring users which means adding friends to study together, it doesn’t seem to be friendly to first time users. Second, they would also like to see an unlocked list of gashapon game figurine silhouettes so that they are more motivated to use the app to study and collect those figurines. Third, they liked that the app does not have a deep focus mode toggle because the app doesn’t really work as what it is supposed to if the switch is off.  Finally, and most importantly, they consider the app a successful app if all the functions in the prototype are in the actual app.
