            Design Hypothesis
          </p>
<p>I believe that there should be a cell phone app that allows the users who would like to travel in the near future to be able to read other people’s experiences before actually deciding where to go for traveling. So that they can make better traveling plans and be aware of the things they may not know well before.</p>
          <p class="bold">Needfinding</p>
        <p>
            Based on my needfinding, I organized a few points to be considered in my design :
            <ol>
                <li>            I find out that 88% of people would love to plan everything out before a trip. Which is pretty normal, and that means the planning process is important to most people who are planning to travel in the near future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    66% of people think that making traveling plans can be a tiring process.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Half of the people who did my survey have the time which they want to travel but do not know where to go.

                </li>
                <li>
                    88% of people read other people’s experiences before visiting.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Different people have different needs when considering taking a visit

                </li>
                <li>
                    Photos are the most important thing to look at when reading other people’s posts. Videos are also something people would like to see.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Everyone seems to find that it’s hard to find the information they need.

                </li>
                <li>
                    The traveler’s app is worthy to develop for people who want to travel.

                </li>
            </ol>

          <p>   <span class="bold">Narrative:</span> Corie loves to travel, however, she didn’t have much time when she was in college since she was studying hard for her dual degree. She was always taking lots of classes during winter session and summer break so that she could graduate on time. Now that she’s graduated, she finally has time to go somewhere without having to worry about homework and exams, she faced another problem. She doesn’t know where to travel. She had so many places in mind but the problem is that is cannot go to every single one of them. She has to pick two out of the ten places in her mind. Doing research on Baidu and Google is very exhausting. She feels like she’s been seeing review articles from people who haven’t even been to those places before. She doesn’t feel like trusting those links which pop up at first when she searches on Google. She needs more reliable advice/information from people who got the real feeling of those places.

            <p><span class="bold">Goal: </span>Trying to make a budget plan of his California trip which happens in a month. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Narrative:  </span>Michael always wanted to go to California with his friend Ian. They are both college students so they don’t have much money to put on their California trip. For example, he couldn’t decide which part of LA he should live to save money on transportation. He had many famous places in mind to visit in LA but he couldn’t organize all of them to make a plan which works out the best. He needs to see what other people do to make the most out of their trips to LA, their plans, their stays, and their experiences. He doesn’t need perfectly written published articles, all he needs is real experiences and plans shared by other people who have similar situations as him.
